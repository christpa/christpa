# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christian Page, and I am a researcher in computational epidemiology at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. 
I have a PhD in genetic epidemiology from the University of Oslo, Norway, which I completed in 2016. 
I have worked at as a researcher in both epidemioglogy and genetic epidemiology, as well as in statistics and modelling. My CV can be found here: https://christpa.github.io/cv.html. 
Throughout my career, I have contributed to numerous research projects that explore the intricate genetic architecture of complex chronic diseases and the intergenerational transmission of disease risk. My work involves leveraging advanced modelling techniques to analyze large, complex datasets, including:

- Extended family trees
- Genetic and other biological markers
- Temporal modeling

In addition to my primary research focus, I am deeply invested in the application of causal models in epidemiology. This involves utilizing registry data to identify causal effects of various environmental exposures or treatments, thereby advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and potential interventions.

## Research Interests
My research interests span the genetic architecture of complex chronic diseases, and the intergenerational transmission of disease risk. 

This includes using advanced modelling in large complex data sets, such as: 
- Extended family trees, 
- Genetic and other biological markers, 
- Combined with temporal information.
- The intergenerational transmission of disease risk. 
 
Another important line of research is the used of causal models in epidemiology from registry data, and how to identify causal effects from different environmental exposures or treatments.
