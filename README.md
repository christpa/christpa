# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christian Page, a researcher in computational epidemiology at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. I have a background in genetic epidemiology, with a PhD from University of Oslo, Norway in 2016. 
I have worked at as a researcher in both genetic and epigenetic epidemiology, as well as in statistics and modelling. My CV can be found here: https://christpa.github.io/cv.html. 

## Research Interests
My research interests span the genetic architecture of complex chronic diseases, and the intergenerational transmission of disease risk. 

This includes using advanced modelling in large complex data sets, such as: 
- Extended family trees, 
- Genetic and other biological markers, 
- Combined with temporal information. 
 
Another important line of research is the used of causal models in epidemiology from registry data, and how to identify causal effects from different environmental exposures or treatments. The lab web page for my resaerch projects can be found here: https://christpa.github.io/.
